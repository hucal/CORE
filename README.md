# CORE
Implementation of SPJ's Tutorial Core compilers written using modern Haskell
programming practices (mostly Monadic error handling and parsing using Parsec)

The template instantiation machine was partially implemented, the GMachine is
entirely implemented (up to Mk6).

I'll be working through the 3 other compilers in the tutorial. I want to learn
how Haskell works, and this tutorial seems like a good rock-bottom starting
point. I'll be done once I implement a [STG machine](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=67083), a more updated version of which is used in the current Haskell
compilation process.
